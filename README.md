# Decision-Tree-Classifier-using-Logistic-Regression
Project: Decision Tree Classification with Logistic Regression-Based Splitting

Objective: To build decision tree classifiers using logistic regression-based splitting on three datasets, evaluate their performance metrics, interpret the output rules, and compare the results with those obtained from regular decision trees.

Approach:

1:
Train decision tree classifiers on all three datasets using logistic regression as the function to split the node, and calculate precision, recall, accuracy, and AUC-ROC curve.
Choose one attribute and pairs of attributes at each node for the split, and report the findings.
Read the Logit Tree paper for relevant information on this topic.

2:
Interpret the rules output from the decision tree by visualizing the tree and split criteria.
Compare the output rules with those from regular decision trees, and make a list of observations from visualizing the splits.
Perform this for both single-attribute and multi-attribute split models.

3:
Perform 5-fold cross-validation on the models and report the performances in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
